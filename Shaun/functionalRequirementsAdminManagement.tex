\chapter{Introduction}
The Computer Science Education Didactic and Applications Research (CSEDAR) team of the Computer Science Department of the University of Pretoria have registered a research project called “The use of Online Discussions in Teaching (TODT)”. The aims of this research is to ﬁnd ways to enhance teaching and improve the learning of students through the use of online discussions. The formation of collaborative communities within student groups has become essential to enhance education. The existence of a forum in which students can express their views and explore what they are learning results in creating a collaborative community in which students can excel. We are faced with the problem of engaging an extremely large number of ﬁrst year students. Engaging ﬁrst year students is a diﬃcult and well-recognised problem, since students tend to feel part of an anonymous mass. As part of the TODT project as a whole, the aim of this COS 301 project is to create an online space where students, teaching assistants and lecturers can engage in activities related to learning the content of our module while applying game concepts to motivate students to increase the quality of their participation and consequently experience deeper learning of the course content.
